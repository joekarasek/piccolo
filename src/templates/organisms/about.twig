                    <h3 class="about__doctor-title">General Dentist</h3>
                    <p class="about__copy">Dr. Anderson grew up in Rockville, Maryland. Since his teenage years, Dr.
                        Anderson has had an interest in dentistry and oral health. After completing high school, he attended
                        the University of Maryland, College Park where he obtained a degree in General Biology, with Honors.
                        From there, Dr. Anderson pursued his interest in dentistry at the Baltimore College of Dental
                        Surgery, University of Maryland. Upon completing his dental degree, he moved to York, Pennsylvania
                        for a General Practice Residency at the York Hospital Dental Center. Here he received advanced
                        training in topics of general dentistry including oral surgery, pediatrics, management of dental
                        emergencies and dental implant placement.</p>
                    <p class="about__copy">One of the things Dr. Anderson enjoys most about dentistry is interacting with
                        his patients in a meaningful way as he helps them obtain a beautiful, healthy smile.</p>
